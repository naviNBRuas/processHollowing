# Code Injection using ptrace in C++

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates how to inject code into a running process using the `ptrace` system call. Code injection is a technique used in software development and cybersecurity to insert code into a running process's address space, enabling the execution of custom code within the context of that process.

## Introduction

Code injection is a powerful technique used in various fields such as software development, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity. It allows developers and security researchers to modify the behavior of a running process by injecting custom code into its address space.

In this repository, we demonstrate how to perform code injection using the `ptrace` system call in C++. The `ptrace` system call allows a process to observe and control the execution of another process. By attaching to a target process and manipulating its memory and execution, we can inject custom code into it.

## Background

### `ptrace` System Call

The `ptrace` system call is a powerful debugging mechanism available on Unix-like operating systems. It allows a process (tracer) to observe and control the execution of another process (tracee). The `ptrace` system call is commonly used by debuggers and process monitoring tools to inspect and manipulate the memory and execution of processes.

### Code Injection

Code injection involves inserting custom code into the memory space of a running process. This technique is used for various purposes, including:

- Patching software vulnerabilities
- Implementing runtime modifications
- Reverse engineering and malware analysis

Code injection can be achieved using different methods, including `ptrace`, DLL injection (on Windows), and direct memory manipulation.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- A Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming and system calls

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Compile the `injector.cpp` file using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o injector injector.cpp
   ```
2. Run the compiled executable, providing the PID of the target process as a command-line argument:
   ```bash
   sudo ./injector <PID>
   ```
Replace <PID> with the Process ID of the target process.

## Understanding the Code
The injector.cpp file contains the code for injecting custom shellcode into a target process. Here's an overview of how the code works:

1. Attaching to the Target Process: The program attaches to the target process using the ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...) system call.

2. Allocating Memory in the Target Process: We allocate memory in the target process using the ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, ...) system call. This memory will be used to store the injected shellcode.

3. Overwriting an Instruction: We overwrite an existing instruction in the target process with a trap instruction (int3). This allows us to inject our shellcode at the location of the overwritten instruction.

4. Setting the Instruction Pointer: We set the instruction pointer (IP) of the target process to the address of the overwritten instruction.

5. Injecting Shellcode: We write our custom shellcode into the allocated memory space of the target process.

6. Detaching from the Target Process: Finally, we detach from the target process using the ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, ...) system call.
